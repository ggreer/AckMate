## Contributing

I'm always willing to look at a pull request.

However, **any** pull requests that include changes to the `ackmate_ack.autogenerated` file will be ignored without comment.

Changes to ack itself should be directed to Andy Lester (the author of ack) via his [github repo](http://github.com/petdance/ack). I will periodically rebase AckMate's version of ack against the offical ack release.
